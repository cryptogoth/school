Ullman's paper "Information Integration Using Logical Views" provides
a nice theoretical formalism for integrating multiple
sources in answering a query, where each source is imperfect:
it may have constraints, incomplete information, or data that is inconsistent
with other views. While this is a very practical problem in commercial
databases, it is a good example where the right abstract model can capture
the essential features of the system and be used to prove useful properties.

It is interesting to note that although the general problem of testing
containing of conjunctive queries is provably hard, in practice it is
acceptable to use brute-force because the query lengths are short.
In this sense, programmers need not waste time trying to think of an
efficient solution or approximation heuristics.

I also found it interesting that the imperfections at each source can
be modeled as solutions which are a subset
of the original query, but that there is a degree of freedom in the
integration algorithm. IM is conceptually cleaner and simpler, but less
flexible in optimizing for certain views and queries. Tsimmis is more
complicated, but allows DBAs to fine-tune the system to their needs.

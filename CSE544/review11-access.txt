In the paper by Rizvi et al., a practical scheme for fine-grained
access control is presented. However, I take issue with their arbitrary
assumption that most middleware duplicates user
access policies in a brittle way that is prone to backdoors.
in practice, enterprise database middleware is modular, open
source, and can access central policy information over a network.
In fact, at the end they propose a software
implementation of access control on top of existing databases, which is
essentially a middleware solution rather than a rewrite of the
query optimizing engines.

Moreover, their example of conditional validity is confusing. It would be
clearer if they stated that conditionally valid queries should not be
able to distinguish between PA-equivalent states.
The example should be restated after the definition: two PA-equivalent
states are (a) when a student is registered for CS101 but there are no grades
entered for it and (b) when a student is not registered for CS101.
These give the same results for the authorized view CoStudentGrades, but
can be distinguished in different states when the user wants to query for
all grades in CS101.

The summary of database history "What Goes Around Comes Around" by
Stonebraker and Hellerstein has many useful lessons, conveniently
summarized at intervals. The most interesting parts, which do not
overlap with the previous Codd paper, deal with the object-relational
(OR) model and XML, and most of the controversial statements are
crammed into the summary at the very end.

The authors insist that XML is only useful for semi-structured data, their
"Case 2" with schema last, and therefore XML databases are a niche market.
This seems unfounded in light of their other comments about XML as a useful
data transfer format (and some disappointing and misleading comments about
"going through a firewall"), and the ease of which they claim XML can be
generated from the relational model. In Section 10.3, they claim that
XML can be parsed/shredded back into tuples in a similar manner to the
way they are generated, but earlier they stated that homogenizing data
was difficult. There is a discrepancy here.

I don't think that enterprises or most people use XML for this purely
semi-structured purpose. I also think that application designers and
database administrators agree upon the schema for generation and shredding
in advance, which is like getting the hard work of homogenizing over with
at the beginning. Therefore the distinction of schema cases is true, but
not very useful in practice.

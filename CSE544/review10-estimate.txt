This article by Getoor, Taskar, and Koller was useful to my
understanding of RDBMSs in three ways.  First, it provides a concise
overview of the assumptions underlying current size estimation
techniques for query results.  Second, it shows how to exploit
correlations between attributes in order to compactly represent joint
probability distributions as Bayesian networks.  Since I haven't had
exposure to this topic before, I learned how this representation was
equivalent to the usual chain rule for conditional probabilities.
Third, it extends the Bayesian network model to handle foreign-key
relationships across multiple tables using join indicator variables.
This last result allows estimation to be extended in a uniform manner.
The last section on empirical tests was interesting to me primarily
because it showed the practical difference between using CPD trees
versus CPD tables.

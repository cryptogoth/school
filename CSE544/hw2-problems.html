Consider the XML data instance Mondial, avaialable <a
 href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/xmldatasets/"> here </a>
(at the bottom of the page). Write XQueries to answer the following
questions. In formulating your questions, you need to understand how
various elements are nested: e.g. what is under a <b>country</b>,
under which element is a <b>city</b> etc. For that it helps if you
inspect the DTD (ignore the warning that the data is not valid), or
inspect the data directly. For each question below turn in the XQuery,
and the result of running the query on the XML data (which should be an
XML document).

<ol type="i">
  <li> Retrieve all the names of all cities located in Peru, sorted
alphabetically. </li>
  <li> Find all countries with more than 20 provinces. </li>
  <li> Find all ethnic groups that live in more than more than 10
countries. </li>
  <li> Find the countries adjacent to the 'Pacific Ocean' sea. </li>
  <li> Find the names of all countries that have at least 3
mountains over 2000m high, and list the names and heights of all
mountains in these countries (regardless of their height). Note: the <b>height</b>
attribute is in meters, so you don' have to do any conversions. </li>
  <li> One user is interested in long rivers. Produce the following
view of the data, containing only rivers longer than 2000 (all units
are in km), in the format described below:
    <ul>
      <li> The root element is <b>user</b> and contains several <b>river</b>
elements </li>
      <li> Each <b>river</b> contains a <b>name</b> element with
the river's name, and several <b>country</b> elements, one for each
country through which it flows. (Note: some rivers may not have any
country, due to noise in the data. It is OK to include these rivers,
even if they look as they flow through no country at all.) </li>
      <li> Each <b>country</b> element contains only the name of
the country (a string).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For each province of China, return its capital. Order the result
by province name.</li>
  <li>For each province(state) in the United States, compute the ratio
of its population to area, and return each province's name, its
computed ratio, and order them by ratio.</li>
  <li>Find all the provinces(states) of&nbsp; the United States with
population more than 11,000,000. Compute the ratio of each qualified
state's population to the whole popolution of the country. Return each
state's name and the ratio. Order by the ratio in descending order.</li>
  <li>For each river which crosses at least 2 countries, return its
name, and the names of the countries it crosses. Order by the numbers
of countries crossed.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p> For this question you need to run <b>galax</b>, which you can
download from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.galaxquery.org/distrib.html">here</a>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="q1.xq">This</a></span>&nbsp;is
what an input file for the galax executable will look like.<br>

The Incognito paper by LeFevre et al. describes an interesting
lattice-based model and graph-based algorithm for finding the
minimum full-domain generalization to k-anonymize a database.
It also defines several parameters to classify previous and future
k-anonymization algorithms.

The main advantages to this approach is that a minimum generalization
can be found by traversing all possibilities and that arbitrary cost
functions can be used. However, there may be cases where more resources
are expended finding the optimal solution than would have been
saved over using a less optimal, but easier to find, solution as in
Samarati's binary search.

Moreover, this paper does not address the case where all k-tuples in a
group have identical values outside of the quasi-identifiers.
In this case, all such tuples can be re-identified.

abstract = {Wiesner's quantum money [5] is a simple, information-theoretically secure quantum cryptographic protocol. In his protocol, a mint issues quantum bills and anyone can query the mint to authenticate a bill. If the mint returns bogus bills when it is asked to authenticate them, then the protocol can be broken in linear time.},

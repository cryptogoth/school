@article{Farhi2010,
abstract = {Quantum money is a cryptographic protocol in which a mint can produce a quantum state, no one else can copy the state, and anyone (with a quantum computer) can verify that the state came from the mint. We present a concrete quantum money scheme based on superpositions of diagrams that encode oriented links with the same Alexander polynomial. We expect our scheme to be secure against computationally bounded adversaries.},

@article{Farhi2009,
abstract = {Given a single copy of a quantum state |$\backslash$psi>, the no cloning theorem greatly limits the amount of information which can be extracted from it. On the other hand, given only a procedure which verifies the state, for example access to a measurement \{1-|psi><psi|, |psi><psi|\}, we cannot prepare |psi> or learn any information about it in polynomial time. In this paper, we consider the scenario in which we are given both a single copy of |psi> and the ability to verify it. We show that in this setting, we can do several things efficiently. We present a new algorithm called quantum state restoration which allows us to copy small subsystems of |psi>. In addition, we present algorithms that can perform tomography on small subsystems of |psi>, and we show to use these algorithms to estimate the statistics of any POVM acting on |psi> in time polynomial in the number of outcomes of the POVM. These algorithms put severe limitations on possible quantum money schemes.},

@article{Lutomirski2009,
abstract = {Public-key quantum money is a cryptographic protocol in which a bank can create quantum states which anyone can verify but no one except possibly the bank can clone or forge. There are no secure public-key quantum money schemes in the literature; as we show in this paper, the only previously published scheme [1] is insecure. We introduce a category of quantum money protocols which we call collision-free. For these protocols, even the bank cannot prepare multiple identical-looking pieces of quantum money. We present a blueprint for how such a protocol might work as well as a concrete example which we believe may be insecure.},

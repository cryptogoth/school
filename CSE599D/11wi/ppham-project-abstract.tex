\section{Abstract}

In this project, I critique the public-key quantum money scheme of
\cite{Farhi2010} based on the hardness of finding equivalent
mathematical knots and creating a weighted superposition of
corresponding grid diagrams that correspond to the same Alexander
polynomial.
I sketch a loose upper bound for the damage to a valid
money state from the verification procedure and characterize the
desired behavior of Markov chain mixing in order to distinguish
valid and invalid money states with a polynomial number of trials.
In conclusion, I propose extensions to this work to create
a more concrete scheme and to defend against future attacks.

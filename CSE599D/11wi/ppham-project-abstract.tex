\section{Abstract}

In this project, I critique the public-key quantum money scheme of
\cite{Farhi2010} based on the hardness of finding equivalent
knots. Making assumptions based on conjectured properties
of grid diagrams,
I estimate the damage to a valid
money state from the verification procedure and characterize the
desired behavior of Markov chain mixing in order to distinguish
valid and invalid money states with a polynomial number of trials.
In conclusion, I propose extending this work for more money-like
features.

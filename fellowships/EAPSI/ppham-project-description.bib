abstract = {We discuss the use of two-dimensional \$\^{}\{9\}\$Be\$\^{}\{+\}\$ ion crystals for experimental tests of quantum control techniques. Our primary qubit is the 124 GHz ground-state electron spin flip transition, which we drive using microwaves. An ion crystal represents a spatial ensemble of qubits, but the effects of inhomogeneities across a typical crystal are small, and as such we treat the ensemble as a single effective spin. We are able to initialize the qubits in a simple state and perform a projective measurement on the system. We demonstrate full control of the qubit Bloch vector, performing arbitrary high-fidelity rotations (\$\backslash tau\_\{\backslash pi\}\backslash sim\$200 \$\backslash mu\$s). Randomized Benchmarking demonstrates an error per gate (a Pauli-randomized \$\backslash pi/2\$ and \$\backslash pi\$ pulse pair) of \$8\backslash pm1\backslash times10\^{}\{-4\}\$. Ramsey interferometry and spin-locking measurements are used to elucidate the limits of qubit coherence in the system, yielding a typical free-induction decay coherence time of \$T\_\{2\}\backslash sim\$2 ms, and a limiting \$T\_\{1\backslash rho\}\backslash sim\$688 ms. These experimental specifications make ion crystals in a Penning trap ideal candidates for novel experiments in quantum control. As such, we briefly describe recent efforts aimed at studying the error-suppressing capabilities of dynamical decoupling pulse sequences, demonstrating an ability to extend qubit coherence and suppress phase errors. We conclude with a discussion of future avenues for experimental exploration, including the use of additional nuclear-spin-flip transitions for effective multiqubit protocols, and the potential for Coulomb crystals to form a useful testbed for studies of large-scale entanglement.},

abstract = {We present a detailed experimental study of the Uhrig Dynamical Decoupling (UDD) sequence in a variety of noise environments. Our qubit system consists of a crystalline array of \$\^{}\{9\}\$Be\$\^{}\{+\}\$ ions confined in a Penning trap. We use an electron-spin-flip transition as our qubit manifold and drive qubit rotations using a 124 GHz microwave system. We study the effect of the UDD sequence in mitigating phase errors and compare against the well known CPMG-style multipulse spin echo as a function of pulse number, rotation axis, noise spectrum, and noise strength. Our results agree well with theoretical predictions for qubit decoherence in the presence of classical phase noise, accounting for the effect of finite-duration \$\backslash pi\$ pulses. Finally, we demonstrate that the Uhrig sequence is more robust against systematic over/underrotation and detuning errors than is multipulse spin echo, despite the precise prescription for pulse-timing in UDD.},

@article{BUVSIB2009c,
abstract = {Any quantum system, such as those used in quantum information or magnetic resonance, is subject to random phase errors that can dramatically affect the fidelity of a desired quantum operation or measurement. In the context of quantum information, quantum error correction techniques have been developed to correct these errors, but resource requirements are extraordinary. The realization of a physically tractable quantum information system will therefore be facilitated if qubit (quantum bit) error rates are far below the so-called fault-tolerance error threshold, predicted to be of the order of 10(-3)-10(-6). The need to realize such low error rates motivates a search for alternative strategies to suppress dephasing in quantum systems. Here we experimentally demonstrate massive suppression of qubit error rates by the application of optimized dynamical decoupling pulse sequences, using a model quantum system capable of simulating a variety of qubit technologies. We demonstrate an analytically derived pulse sequence, UDD, and find novel sequences through active, real-time experimental feedback. The latter sequences are tailored to maximize error suppression without the need for a priori knowledge of the ambient noise environment, and are capable of suppressing errors by orders of magnitude compared to other existing sequences (including the benchmark multi-pulse spin echo). Our work includes the extension of a treatment to predict qubit decoherence under realistic conditions, yielding strong agreement between experimental data and theory for arbitrary pulse sequences incorporating nonidealized control pulses. These results demonstrate the robustness of qubit memory error suppression through dynamical decoupling techniques across a variety of qubit technologies.},

@article{Hanneke2009,
abstract = {The universal quantum computer1 is a device capable of simulating any physical system2 and represents a major goal for the field of quantum information science. In the context of quantum information, ‘universal’ refers to the ability to carry out arbitrary unitary transformations in the system’s computational space3. Combining arbitrary single-quantum-bit (qubit) gates with an entangling two-qubit gate provides a set of gates capable of achieving universal control of any number of qubits4, 5, 6, provided that these gates can be carried out repeatedly and between arbitrary pairs of qubits. Although gate sets have been demonstrated in several technologies7, they have so far been tailored towards specific tasks, forming a small subset of all unitary operators. Here we demonstrate a quantum processor that can be programmed with 15 classical inputs to realize arbitrary unitary transformations on two qubits, which are stored in trapped atomic ions. Using quantum state and process tomography8, we characterize the fidelity of our implementation for 160 randomly chosen operations. This universal control is equivalent to simulating any pairwise interaction between spin-1/2 systems. A programmable multiqubit register could form a core component of a large-scale quantum processor, and the methods used here are suitable for such a device9.},

@article{Dawson2005,
abstract = {This pedagogical review presents the proof of the Solovay-Kitaev theorem in the form of an efficient classical algorithm for compiling an arbitrary single-qubit gate into a sequence of gates from a fixed and finite set. The algorithm can be used, for example, to compile Shor's algorithm, which uses rotations of \$\backslash pi / 2\^{}k\$, into an efficient fault-tolerant form using only Hadamard, controlled-\{$\backslash$sc not\}, and \$\backslash pi / 8\$ gates. The algorithm runs in \$O(\backslash log\^{}\{2.71\}(1/\backslash epsilon))\$ time, and produces as output a sequence of \$O(\backslash log\^{}\{3.97\}(1/\backslash epsilon))\$ quantum gates which is guaranteed to approximate the desired quantum gate to an accuracy within \$\backslash epsilon > 0\$. We also explain how the algorithm can be generalized to apply to multi-qubit gates and to gates from \$SU(d)\$.},

By process tomography we assess the performance of the gates for different experimental realizations and demonstrate the advantage of amplitude--shaped laser pulses over simple square pulses. We also investigate whether the performance of concatenated gates can be inferred from the analysis of the single gates.},

The control procedure is implemented as a sequence of radiofrequency pulses that repetitively flip the state of the system, a technique that can be termed quantum "bang-bang" control after its classical analog. Decoherence introduced by the system's interaction with a quantum environment is shown to be washed out completely in the limit of continuous flipping and greatly suppressed provided the interval between the pulses is made comparable to the correlation time of the environment. The model suggests a strategy to fight against decoherence that complements existing quantum error-correction techniques.},

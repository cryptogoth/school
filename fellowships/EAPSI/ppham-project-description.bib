abstract = {We present a detailed experimental study of the Uhrig Dynamical Decoupling (UDD) sequence in a variety of noise environments. Our qubit system consists of a crystalline array of \$\^{}\{9\}\$Be\$\^{}\{+\}\$ ions confined in a Penning trap. We use an electron-spin-flip transition as our qubit manifold and drive qubit rotations using a 124 GHz microwave system. We study the effect of the UDD sequence in mitigating phase errors and compare against the well known CPMG-style multipulse spin echo as a function of pulse number, rotation axis, noise spectrum, and noise strength. Our results agree well with theoretical predictions for qubit decoherence in the presence of classical phase noise, accounting for the effect of finite-duration \$\backslash pi\$ pulses. Finally, we demonstrate that the Uhrig sequence is more robust against systematic over/underrotation and detuning errors than is multipulse spin echo, despite the precise prescription for pulse-timing in UDD.},

abstract = {Any quantum system, such as those used in quantum information or magnetic resonance, is subject to random phase errors that can dramatically affect the fidelity of a desired quantum operation or measurement. In the context of quantum information, quantum error correction techniques have been developed to correct these errors, but resource requirements are extraordinary. The realization of a physically tractable quantum information system will therefore be facilitated if qubit (quantum bit) error rates are far below the so-called fault-tolerance error threshold, predicted to be of the order of 10(-3)-10(-6). The need to realize such low error rates motivates a search for alternative strategies to suppress dephasing in quantum systems. Here we experimentally demonstrate massive suppression of qubit error rates by the application of optimized dynamical decoupling pulse sequences, using a model quantum system capable of simulating a variety of qubit technologies. We demonstrate an analytically derived pulse sequence, UDD, and find novel sequences through active, real-time experimental feedback. The latter sequences are tailored to maximize error suppression without the need for a priori knowledge of the ambient noise environment, and are capable of suppressing errors by orders of magnitude compared to other existing sequences (including the benchmark multi-pulse spin echo). Our work includes the extension of a treatment to predict qubit decoherence under realistic conditions, yielding strong agreement between experimental data and theory for arbitrary pulse sequences incorporating nonidealized control pulses. These results demonstrate the robustness of qubit memory error suppression through dynamical decoupling techniques across a variety of qubit technologies.},

Factoring large integers is therefore conjectured to be intractable classically, an observation underlying the security of widely used cryptographic codes. Quantum computers, however, could factor integers in only polynomial time, using Shor's quantum factoring algorithm. Although important for the study of quantum computers, experimental demonstration of this algorithm has proved elusive. Here we report an implementation of the simplest instance of Shor's algorithm: factorization of N = 15 (whose prime factors are 3 and 5). We use seven spin-1/2 nuclei in a molecule as quantum bits, which can be manipulated with room temperature liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. This method of using nuclei to store quantum information is in principle scalable to systems containing many quantum bits, but such scalability is not implied by the present work. The significance of our work lies in the demonstration of experimental and theoretical techniques for precise control and modelling of complex quantum computers. In particular, we present a simple, parameter-free but predictive model of decoherence effects in our system.},

An adiabatic method for the preparation of a good approximate ground-state wave function is described and demonstrated for a stretched hydrogen molecule.

We can not translate quantum behaviour arising with superposition states or entanglement efficiently into the classical language of conventional computers. The final solution to this problem is a universal quantum computer [1], suggested in 1982 and envisioned to become functional within the next decade(s); a shortcut was proposed via simulating the quantum behaviour of interest in a different quantum system, where all parameters and interactions can be controlled and the outcome detected sufficiently well. Here we study the feasibility of a quantum simulator based on trapped ions [2]. We experimentally simulate the adiabatic evolution of the smallest non-trivial spin system from the paramagnetic into the (anti-)ferromagnetic order with a quantum magnetisation for two spins of 98\%, controlling and manipulating all relevant parameters of the Hamiltonian independently via electromagnetic fields. We prove that the observed transition is not driven by thermal fluctuations, but of quantum mechanical origin, the source of quantum fluctuations in quantum phase transitions [3]. We observe a final superposition state of the two degenerate spin configurations for the ferromagnetic and the antiferromagnetic order, respectively. These correspond to deterministically entangled states achieved with a fidelity up to 88\%. Our work demonstrates a building block for simulating quantum spin-Hamiltonians with trapped ions. The method has potential for scaling to a higher number of coupled spins [2].},

Quantum interferences enforce asymmetric, non-classical distributions in the highly entangled degrees of freedom (of coin and position states).

abstract = {The universal quantum computer1 is a device capable of simulating any physical system2 and represents a major goal for the field of quantum information science. In the context of quantum information, ‘universal’ refers to the ability to carry out arbitrary unitary transformations in the system’s computational space3. Combining arbitrary single-quantum-bit (qubit) gates with an entangling two-qubit gate provides a set of gates capable of achieving universal control of any number of qubits4, 5, 6, provided that these gates can be carried out repeatedly and between arbitrary pairs of qubits. Although gate sets have been demonstrated in several technologies7, they have so far been tailored towards specific tasks, forming a small subset of all unitary operators. Here we demonstrate a quantum processor that can be programmed with 15 classical inputs to realize arbitrary unitary transformations on two qubits, which are stored in trapped atomic ions. Using quantum state and process tomography8, we characterize the fidelity of our implementation for 160 randomly chosen operations. This universal control is equivalent to simulating any pairwise interaction between spin-1/2 systems. A programmable multiqubit register could form a core component of a large-scale quantum processor, and the methods used here are suitable for such a device9.},

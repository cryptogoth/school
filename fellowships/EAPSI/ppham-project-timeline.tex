custom boards to design.
\item
Begin custom board design, choose components.
\end{itemize}

Components:
\begin{itemize}
\item
FPGA sequencer
\item DDS
\item Arbitrary waveform generator
\item Breakout board

\item
Design system and wiring scheme for controlling all board from FPGA sequencer,
including clock system.
\item
Physically lay out rackmount chassis to store entire pulse programmer,
including faceplate design.
\end{itemize}

\section{Week 2: June 21-27, 2010}
